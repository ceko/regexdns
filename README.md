regexdns
========

A very simple DNS server that allows you to resolve domains to an ip by regular expressions.

Create a hosts.txt file in the same directory as your dns_server.py.  Configure per the instructions in hosts.txt.template.

The purpose of this project is to build on the functionality offered by the hosts file.  I had a need to test a domain that has an infinite amount of subdomains, and I didn't want to install a full-fledged DNS server.
